Implementation of my bachelor's thesis based on "An Efficient Implementation of the Gaussâ€“Newton Method Via Generalized Krylow Subspaces" https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-023-02360-w

Note on Execution Time Measurement:
Execution time measurement was implemented but is not included in the thesis due to potential inaccuracies arising from different implementation strategies e.g in C or Python.
Only metrics like like iterations, jacobain evaluations, function evaluations or matrice vector multiplications will be discussed.
Hence the code was not optimized further for speed and occasionally contains callbacks that may never be accessed.

Note on not using scipy functions lstqr and lsqr:
The usage of scipy.linalg.lstqr and scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr were replaced by QR decomposition and CGLS methods, respectively.
Because a discussion of the underlying LAPACK routines would exeed the scope of my bachelor thesis.
